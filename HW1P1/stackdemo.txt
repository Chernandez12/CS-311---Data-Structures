************** STACK Test Program *************
This program tests an integer stack ADT implemented as
an array.  
It is a menu based program allowing you to test each method. 
It displays the entire stack whenever it is modified.
***********************************************

MENU: These are your options: 

   (1) Push an element   
   (2) Display the entire stack  
   (3) Pop the top element
   (4) Display the top element
   (5) Check to see if is it empty
   (6) Check to see if is it full
   (7) Clear the entire stack
    Enter ( 0 ) to quit 
===>2
The current contents are:
